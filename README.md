# Etch-a-Sketch
A funny game

This is a game I've created in a few hours. It creates a grid of square divs and changes its color to black when the cursor hover each one of the items. 

The design is rudimentary but the javascript requires knowledge on:
 - DOM manipulation
 - The use of functions and events
 - Use of variables and changing them
 - Conditionals and loops
